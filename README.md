# TAS-Codewars-solutions
This repository contains the files(for windows in windows.zip) and the solutions to the PES University TAS(The Amateur Scientist) Fest's Codewars event. This is specifically the solutions of round two of the codewars challenge.

After extracting windows.zip, there is a pdf with the questions and how to provide input, and 10 executable files corresponding to the ten questions.Execute these .exe files from the command prompt and provide your own input, and see the expected output.Using the basic information given in the question and testing against various inputs, you need to solve the questions.

My solutions are in Python 2.7, but the challenge can be done in Java, c++, or anything really.
Oh, and the time limit is two hours.
Have fun coding! :D
